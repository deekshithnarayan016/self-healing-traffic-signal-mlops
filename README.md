## City-Scale Traffic Network (Day 1 Extension)

- Created a city-style SUMO network using a 3×3 grid
- Designed a heterogeneous junction layout:
  - Signalized intersections (traffic lights)
  - Priority-controlled junctions
  - Roundabouts
- Generated realistic traffic demand using randomTrips
- Validated mixed traffic behavior in SUMO GUI

This network will be used for multi-junction self-healing traffic control experiments.
